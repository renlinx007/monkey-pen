An Enhancement of MonkeyRunner For Android

The monkeyrunner tool provides an API for writing programs that control an Android device or emulator from outside of Android code. 
With monkeyrunner, you can write a `Python` program that installs an Android application or test package, runs it, sends keystrokes to it, 
takes screenshots of its user interface, and stores screenshots on the workstation. The monkeyrunner tool is primarily designed to test applications and devices at the functional/framework level and for running unit test suites, but you are free to use it for other purposes.


This Project aims to provide some improvement to the MonkeyRunner API layer provided to python.
